Music Blocks is a tangible beat sequencer. It is inspired by
http://murderandcreate.com/tangiblesequencer/

How it works:
Place blocks on the screen by dragging them from the box in the upper left onto the wooden surface.
To make a block play its tone, double click it. Notice that the triangular area in front of it
pulses. This is called its "effect area." Try dragging another block above the first block such
that it is inside this effect area, then double click the first block again. This time, the first
block plays its note, followed by the second block. By putting blocks inside effect areas, blocks
can be chained together to play a sequence of notes. Try the sample songs!
